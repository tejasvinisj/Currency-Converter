# Currency-Converter
 Currency converter (currency exchange)is a mini project coded in Java programming language.This simple application provides a interface    for exchanging/converting money from one currency to another currency .Different  countries  use  different  currency,  and  there  is  daily  variation  in  these  currencies relative  to  one  another.  
  Those  who  transfer  money  from  one  country  to  another  (one currency  to  another)  must  be  updated  with  the  latest  currency  exchange  rates  in  the market. 
  Here we are converting from Indian currency to dollar and pounds.And we can make this as currency conerter app,users  are  provided with  an  option  to  select  the  type  of conversion,  from “this” currency to “that” currency. This simple feature allows users to enter amount to be converted and display the converted amount.So we created one super class called rupee,and from that superclas, we created two subclass called pounds and dollar.Here we convert from rupee to pound and dollar using some conversion factor.This project includes all the topics covered in the class.
